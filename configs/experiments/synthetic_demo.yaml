# This configuration file is for running a synthetic demo experiment.
# It uses a short sample of a speech signal as the target and handpicked RIRs.
# The noise is a sinusoidal signal with varying SNR and harmonic correlation.
# The results are averaged over 2 Monte Carlo simulations.
# The results are printed and plotted without using Tex.
